# Packaged
Sending simple HTTP requests hasn't ever been so easy.

Java's verbosity often feels cumbersome, especially when it comes to tasks so essential, you'd expect them to be perfect. One such case is **HTTP requests**. Most of the time, your task is as simple as fetching some data from the web. Don't you wish the process were simpler? **Packaged** aims to abstract out all the complexity of HTTP requests by providing convenient methods that not only feel modern but also help your workflow.

## Why Packaged?
Packaged was made specifically to reduce the boilerplate code you have to write and bring you straight to the point instead.
- **Async-To-Go**: Asynchronious by design. Keep your code responsive while waiting for the server to respond.
- **0 Boilerplate**: Forget the tedious setup of `HTTPConnection` for basic tasks.
- **JS-Inspired Syntax**: Call a single method and instantly get the response.

> [!NOTE]
> Packaged is by no means a competitor the the `HTTPClient` class. It instead tries to simplify what already should be simple.
